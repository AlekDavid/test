            <b><u>
           </u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>“Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" may at first just seem like a kids’ movie, <br>
           </u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>but believe me when I tell you that it forever changed the animation industry. <br> <br>
           </u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>This movie is REMARKABLE for its very unique style, as it very specifically searched for the visual approach of a comic-book. <br>
           </u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>To obtain this approach, the studio combined both traditional 2D hand-drawn animation techniques, with computer-generated 3D imagery,<br>
           </u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>which ultimately led to a never-before-seen visual experience for audiences; and inspired many more artists not just to tag along the new style,<br>
           </u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>but also to stretch their minds in the animation realm and create their own. <br> <br>
           </u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The film's success demonstrated that there is a demand for more diverse and innovative animation styles, <br>
           </u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>and has paved the way for more experimentation in the industry. <br>
           </u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" also won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, <br>
           </u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>solidifying its impact on the animation world.

            <h1> &nbsp; THE ANIMATION OF <br> &nbsp; PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH</h1>

            <h4>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  From the animation style to its storytelling through color, its fantasy-like style, <br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  and with its production having started on the same year that “Into The Spider-Verse” was released, <br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  it’s no great discovery that “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” was massively influenced by the former. <br> <br>

             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Besides its inspiration though, I can confidently say that “Puss In Boots: The Last Wish” <br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  set the bar so incredibly high up in the entertainment industry. <br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The writing and direction of the characters’ journey holds great lessons that despite being in a “kids’ movie”, they easily get into one’s deep <br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  thoughts. This is achieved not just through great writing, but also through its amazing use of music and atmosphere that put you just right in <br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  the characters position, thus, making you feel what they feel.

                        “Animator vs Animation”.

                     prepared the stage for his series of animations with the same premise. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
